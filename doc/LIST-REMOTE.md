# LIST-REMOTE Command - Node Version Switcher
```
nvs lsr [remote]
nvs ls-remote [remote]
nvs list-remote [remote]
```
Lists node versions available to download and add. If a remote name is specified then only versions from that remote are listed; otherwise all versions from all remotes are listed.

A remote name is one of the keys from the `remotes` mapping in `$NVS_HOME/settings.json`.
